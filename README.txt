Assignment:

Code the attached 'Assignment.png' file into an HTM/CSS responsive web page, using the attached images. No need to add more elements that what you see on the design. Use this mini-project as a way to show off your understanding of front-end website building techniques. Feel free to use a grid or css framework of your choice, or make it from scratch. Put your work into a github repository and send me back the link.

Fonts to use: Roboto Condensed for the title (Construction Contractors), and Lato for everything else.
